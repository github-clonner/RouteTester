  "readme": "Shift8 provides a simple mechanism over the AJAM asterisk interface. \nApart from the obvious reason of providing an easy way to talk with a remote asterisk server, the main benefit of having an intermediate library between a software and an Asterisk server, is mostly that you can isolate the remote Asterisk, protecting the credentials and the entire PBX\n\nAnd all of that with a twist of node.js\n\nRequirements:\n\nlibxmljs\nwinston - Might be removed in future versions.\n\nThis is still a work in progress, see the tests.js for example on usage.\n\nEvents emited:\n\n'event': \tWhen an event occurs on the remote asterisk\n'connected':\tWhen the library connects\n'disconnected':\tWhen the library disconnects\n'error':\tWhen an error occurs\n\nThis has been tested and works properly on Asterisk 10.7.0. Also in the last version there has been better support for the AsyncAGI command, as well as the new ConfBridge application of Asterisk 10\n\nHow to enable manager interface on asterisk:\n\nYou must initially enable the manager interface in the asterisk by editing asterisk/manager.conf. You need to set:\n\nenabled = yes\nwebenabled = yes\n\nYou also need to create a manager for Shift8 to connect with:\n\n[manager]\nsecret = secret\ndeny = 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0\npermit = 127.0.0.1/255.255.255.0\nread = system,call,log,verbose,agent,user,config,dtmf,reporting,cdr,dialplan\nwrite = system,call,agent,user,config,command,reporting,originate\n\n(Make sure you permit the ip address where shift8 is running)\n\nFinally you must edit http.conf and enable it by setting \"enable\" attribute to yes.\n\nInstallation\n\nSimple as nmp install node-shift8\n",
